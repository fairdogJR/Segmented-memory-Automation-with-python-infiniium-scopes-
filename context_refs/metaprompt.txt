Role / goal You are an expert Keysight oscilloscope automation engineer. I am configuring an MXR oscilloscope (similar to UXR) and I want to replicate a known-good setup using SCPI and then Python. I am uploading: A default setup file (baseline) TIM_PULSE1.set (the target setup; contains the differences) if anything us unclear, ask me, also generate debug output so you can iterate if needed. I will be transferring this to github copilot at some point but you may succeed before that A reference program that already uses SCPI for similar functionality (use this as the “SCPI dictionary” and style guide) Task Parse and compare the default setup file vs TIM_PULSE1.set. Identify only the meaningful functional differences (ignore metadata like timestamps, file headers, checksums, serialization noise, etc.). For each functional difference, infer the scope feature/functionality it represents (e.g., acquisition mode, segmented/sequence mode, timebase, trigger, channels, bandwidth limit, measurement, math, etc.). Using the reference program, find the exact SCPI command(s) that correspond to each difference. If the reference program contains the command: quote the command exactly and cite where it appears (function name / section / line range if available). If a difference is not covered in the reference program: propose the most likely SCPI command(s) and label it clearly as inferred. Produce a SCPI command list in the correct order to reproduce TIM_PULSE1.set starting from default state. Deliverables A) Diff-to-functionality table with these columns: Setting / Feature Default value TIM_PULSE1 value What this changes on the scope (plain English) SCPI command(s) Source (Reference program vs Inferred) B) A clean SCPI script (one command per line) to apply the TIM_PULSE1 configuration. C) A Python implementation that connects to the MXR over LAN at 10.81.185.89 and applies the SCPI sequence: Use PyVISA (or socket SCPI if you think that’s better—pick one and be consistent) Include connection setup, timeout handling, *IDN? sanity check, and *OPC?/synchronization where appropriate Functions: connect(ip) apply_setup(scpi_commands) verify_key_settings() (query a few key settings to confirm) Print clear status messages Scope specifics / constraints This is for an MXR, not a UXR. If a command might differ by model, call it out and suggest the safest/most compatible alternative. The goal setup is for capturing pulses in sequence/segmented mode (the “pulse capture in sequence mode” use case). Prefer commands and patterns found in the reference program unless there’s a strong reason not to. Output format Start with a short summary of the highest-impact differences (3–8 bullets). Then provide the table (Deliverable A). Then the ordered SCPI list (Deliverable B). Then the Python code (Deliverable C). Important Do not invent commands if they are not supported—if uncertain, mark as uncertain and provide a likely query/confirm step. Keep everything deterministic and reproducible.
